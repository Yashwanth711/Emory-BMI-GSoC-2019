# Emory BMI GSoC 2019

Welcome to GSoC 2019. We have applied as a GSoC organization, and we look forward to working with you this summer.  This year we will be using Slack as the primary medium of communication. Each idea on this page has a mentor assigned. You can find their email addresses on this page. Contact your mentor with the name of the project you are interested in, and they will invite you to our Slack team  (gsoc2019-bmi.slack.com). All communication will then happen on Slack. Discuss the project on Slack, and once you are ready to submit your application, use the template below. You must submit your application directly to our organization using the GSoC Program Site.
